# Proxy-Guru
What is Proxy Guru?

Proxy Guru is a life saver for college students.
A lot of times we don't feel like going to college to attend some lectures, but still due to attendance compulsions and grade penalty threats we have to attend those lectures.
Proxy Guru is an online exchange platform where people send out there requests for proxy in attendance and other students offer their services for a nominal fee(in the form of treat or small amount of money).

Can't figure out what the we have built?
